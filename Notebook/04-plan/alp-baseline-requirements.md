# ALP baseline requirements

## Scope

These requirements govern the ALP study only: the geomagnetic
ALP–photon detection channel, its modelling, and the DarkNESS mission
analysis that selects an observing ConOps for it. They follow the
project statement in [[project-charter]]:

> Using the DarkNESS platform, what observing ConOps maximises the
> identifiable geomagnetic ALP–photon conversion signal against
> particle and diffuse X-ray backgrounds, and what does that ConOps
> require of the mission?

Out of scope: the DarkNESS platform design, the sterile-neutrino
program, and the coupling limit (a conditional follow-on, charter
§Research question).

## Form

Each requirement is one sentence: *The ⟨work product⟩ shall ⟨verb⟩
⟨object⟩ ⟨qualifier⟩.* One obligation per line, no "and", no "or".
The subject is always a work product, never a person. Each carries a
verification method and one status:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Met** | verified; evidence cited |
| **Open** | not yet verified |
| **Gated** | verification waits on a named decision gate |
| **Retired** | withdrawn by a decision; kept for traceability |

Verification methods: **T** test in `tests/`, **A** analysis recorded
in `Notebook/`, **I** inspection of code or note, **R** independent
review.

Changing a requirement is a dated entry in [[../decisions]]; the
status column here is updated with the evidence pointer.

| ALP-CH-02 | The source model shall include the Milky Way line component at $E_0 = m_\chi/2$. | T | **Open** |
| ALP-CH-03 | The source model shall include the extragalactic continuum component with support only at $E \le E_0$. | T | **Open** |
| ALP-CH-04 | The source model shall derive the Milky Way component from the same parent parameters $(f_\chi, \tau_\chi, \mathcal B_{aa})$ as the extragalactic component. | A | **Open** — D15 |
| ALP-CH-05 | The Milky Way component shall scale with the dark-matter column density $D_\chi(l,b)$ along the boresight. | T | **Met** — `test_source.TestHalo`, `d_gevcm2` |

| ALP-CH-08 | The conversion model shall carry the phase $q = m_a^2/2E$ along each ray. | T | **Met** — `test_phase_reduces_amplitude` |
| ALP-CH-09 | The conversion model shall reproduce the analytic $\mathrm{sinc}^2$ result for a uniform field with constant phase. | T | **Open** |

| ALP-CH-13 | The conversion model shall include the plasma frequency term in the phase. | T | **Open** |
| ALP-CH-14 | The conversion model shall take the internal geomagnetic field as a separable input from any external field. | I | **Open** |
| ALP-CH-15 | The conversion kernel shall be averaged over the 20° full-cone aperture. | T | **Met** — `test_fov_hairline_cone_is_the_boresight`, [[../2026-09-23-fov-field-integral]] |

ALP-CH-18 to ALP-CH-22 are retired (D26): at the CAST coupling limit
the geomagnetically converted cosmic ALP background is at most
$10^{-14}$ of the diffuse X-ray background in 1–10 keV. The same
conversion probability applies to every isotropic source, which sets
the bar the extragalactic continuum must clear at the viability gate.
