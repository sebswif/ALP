# DarkNESS parameter register

Canonical numbers for the DarkNESS ALP study. **Every parameter used anywhere in this line of work
resolves to a row in this table.** If a number is not here, it is not yet real.

## Provenance tags

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `DN-V` | DarkNESS, **verified** against Alpine et al. 2025 (ASR 76, 4793) with page number |
| `DN-TBC` | DarkNESS-specific but **not yet confirmed** — needs the team, a design doc, or an ICD |
| `EXT` | External literature (Yamamoto 2020, IGRF, etc.) |
| `ASSUME` | Our modelling choice, made here, revisable |
| `DERIV` | Derived in this vault, with the derivation shown |

The discipline: never let a `DN-TBC` or `ASSUME` silently become a `DN-V`. A projected sensitivity
curve inherits the weakest tag in its chain.

### Two corrections to earlier working numbers

- The `LimitCalculation` sterile-neutrino chain uses `area_cm2 = 8.0` and `efficiency = 0.20`. The paper
  states **12 cm²**. Whatever 8 cm² represented (a de-rating? an earlier design?) it is not the published
  collecting area — resolve before reusing that chain. See [[../open-questions|open questions]].
- Cross-check on 12 cm²: 4 × 1.35×10⁶ px × (15 µm)² = **12.15 cm²** `DERIV`. The published figure is the
  raw sensor area, so effective area is 12 cm² × QE(E) × live fraction.

### Why 20° is read as a full cone

The paper states one DarkNESS exposure sees diffuse flux "comparable to 22 XMM EPIC-MOS images" (p. 4797),
with EPIC-MOS at 30 arcmin FOV and 700 cm² at 3 keV. That gives an MOS grasp of

$$
A\,\Omega\big|_{\rm MOS} = 700\ {\rm cm^2} \times 5.98\times10^{-5}\ {\rm sr} = 4.19\times10^{-2}\ {\rm cm^2\,sr}
$$

so 22 × MOS ≈ 0.92 cm² sr. With A = 12 cm² that implies Ω ≈ 0.077 sr, i.e. a half-angle of ≈ 9°.
A 10° half-angle (Ω = 0.0955 sr) gives 27 × MOS — consistent within the slop of which energy and QE are
assumed. A 20° **half**-angle would give 108 ×, which is not what the paper claims.

**So: half-angle 10°, Ω ≈ 0.0955 sr.** Confirmed by the team 2026-09-24; the 40° in ASR Fig. 10 is the obstruction keep-out across pixel positions. Originally `DERIV` because §2.2 separately refers to a
"20° radius" region for the Galactic Centre *background model* — that is a sky region for background
estimation, not the FOV, but the collision of terms is exactly the kind of thing that needs confirming.

## Grasp, and what it buys

| Instrument | Effective area | Ω [sr] | Grasp [cm² sr] |
|---|---|---|---|
| DarkNESS, geometric | 12 cm² | 0.0955 | 1.15 |
| DarkNESS, with 50 % masking and QE ~0.9 | ~5.4 cm² | 0.0955 | ~0.52 |
| Suzaku XIS, one unit | ~330 cm² at 1.5 keV | 2.68×10⁻⁵ | 8.8×10⁻³ |
| Suzaku XIS, three units (Yamamoto's set) | — | — | 2.6×10⁻² |

`DERIV`, Suzaku numbers `EXT`. DarkNESS has roughly **20× the grasp** Yamamoto had, conservatively.
Because the signal is diffuse, this is the correct comparison — not effective area, where a focusing
telescope wins by two orders of magnitude. See [[../01-physics/sensitivity-scaling|sensitivity scaling]]
for what 20× actually buys (spoiler: 20^(1/4) ≈ 2.1 in coupling).
